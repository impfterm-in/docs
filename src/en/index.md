# Welcome!

Kiebitz is an [open source](https://github.com/kiebitz-oss), free and freely usable software solution for privacy-friendly appointment scheduling. This page documents the protocol and applications that make up Kiebitz.

## The characteristics of Kiebitz[^1]

Kiebitz systematically minimizes privacy & security risks for users of the system:

* Contact details and appointment details are exchanged end-to-end encrypted between users and providers.
* Profiling opportunities through metadata analysis in the appointment brokering process are systematically minimized.
* Individual system components can be federated and operated independently.
* All components and protocols are open source and can be freely used and audited.
* Possibilities for misuse of the system are largely excluded by technical and organisational measures.
