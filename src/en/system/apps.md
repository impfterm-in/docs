# Applications

Kiebitz provides various applications for users, operators of localities and health authorities, which are described here.

## User application

Users register a priority token via the user web app and submit an appointment request in a catchment area. As soon as you receive an appointment offer, you select a specific appointment and confirm or decline the offer.

## Provider application

Providers register via the provider web app, enter basic data about their location and upload the encrypted data to the appointment backend for verification. After verification, they create appointments and the app automatically distributes them to users.  

## Agent application

Intermediaries use the Intermediary Web App to verify providers and, if necessary, to investigate and prevent misuse of the system.
